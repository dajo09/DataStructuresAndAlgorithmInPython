## Step-by-Step Solution to a Programming Problem (Longest Palindromic Substring) in Python

Data Structures & Algorithms in Python Course Project

### A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or sequence of words that reads the same backward as forward.

A few interesting facts on Palindromes:

- The longest single-word palindrome in the English language, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is the onomatopoeic 'tattarrattat', coined by James Joyce in Ulysses (1922) for a knock on the door.
- Palindromes are seen in dates, and even in acoustics when a phrase once recorded and played backward sounds the same. Palindromes are also found in modern and classical music pieces.
- The word palindrome is derived from the Greek 'palin,' or "back" and 'dromos' or "direction." The actual Greek phrase alluded to the backward movement of the crab. Palindromes date back to about 70AD.
- This first known palindrome was in Latin and read **"sator arepo tenet opera rotas"** which means either:
<br/>
    The sower Arepo holds the wheels with effort.
    or
    The sower Arepo leads with his hand the plough.
 
<br/>
After a little intro to palindromes, let us now get to the problem at hand.
